# Prime Number Checker

This program checks if a given number is a prime number or not.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).

   ```bash
   gcc PrimeNumberChecker.c -o PrimeNumberChecker

2. Run the compiled executable.
   ```bash
   ./PrimeNumberChecker

3. Enter a number when prompted.
    '''bash
    Enter a number to check for primality: [your_input]

4. The program will then output whether the entered number is a prime number or not.

## Note
The program uses a simple algorithm to check for primality by testing divisibility.<br>
It is designed to work with positive integers greater than 1. <br>
